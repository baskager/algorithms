# Big-O notation

The Big-O notation is a way to describe the performance of an algorithm in its worst-case complexity. Big-O can describe performance in (run)time or the amount of resources needed.

There are other notations to describe best-case and average-case complexity.

The complexity of an algorithm can be determined by analyzing the code. For instance, if the code always performs the same amount of steps the worst-case time complexity is `O(1)`.

Below there are some examples of the Big-O notation.
